        <h2>Summary:</h2>
       
            <p>Actively seeking a full stack software developer position. Currently working on projects
                specializing in HTML, CSS, and JS using React and Node.js. As an individual with a unique work history and experience, 
                I am passionate about combining our natural world with our modern world of technology. Modern technologies 
                can be developed to assist scientists in the saving of our planet, for example developing
                software that allows scientists to have new breakthrough technologies in assistance of endangered species or resources' conservation, research, and protection.
